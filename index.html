    <p><i>Interesting facts about owls</i></p>
    <ol>
        <li>The eyes of an owl are not true “eyeballs.” Their tube-shaped eyes are completely immobile, providing binocular vision which fully focuses on their prey and boosts depth perception.</li>

           <li>A group of owls is called a parliament. This originates from C.S. Lewis’ description of a meeting of owls in The Chronicles of Narnia.</li> 
            
            <li>The Northern Hawk Owl can detect—primarily by sight—a vole to eat up to a half a mile away.</li>
